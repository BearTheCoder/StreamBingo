# About

https://streambingo.live


Hi, Hello.
Stream Bingo was an idea I had after coming across a website called https://nobody.live that displayed all of the current Twitch streamers that currently have no viewers.
Curious on how creating such a website was possible, I started to program. I came up with the idea of stream bingo, because, well, just displaying random streams seemed boring.
Originally,. the website was create for a YouTube project that has since been finished.
You can find that project here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh8HaIL4VS0

Now, the project is live for anyone to use.

The project is hosted on https://railway.app with future plans to be migrated to docker. (If i can take the time out to learn docker)

If you have any question or want to be involved, reach out to me on Discord.

# Issues and Excuses

-   Issue # 1 - Loading screen
      There is a reason why the loading screen is there, it's loading. But why? Cost effectiveness? Maybe.
      The Twitch API allows you to make 800 calls to the API per minute. And it is free. So, there is no cost there.
      Railway.app on the other hand, charges me per usage.
      So, what does this mean?
